The use of column as a structural member is well known to all of us. But the problem with Column is that it buckles.
Buckling of a Colum refers to a phenomenon where a Colum fails under compressive load by bending or lateral deformation.
On analysis it was found that Simply supported columns undergoing lateral vibration and Euler buckling have similar bending moment distributions with low values near the ends of the column.
The typical solution is either the area of cross-section  of a uniform rod is increased or the a tapered rod is used which has more mass at the center and thus weight is saved.
